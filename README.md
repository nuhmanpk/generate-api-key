API Key Generation Package

This package provides a convenient way to generate API keys using a secret, seed, and an optional include keyword. The generated keys are unique and secure, making them suitable for use in a variety of applications.

The package supports generating API keys using a variety of methods such as UUID v5 and SHA-256 algorithm. The keys are generated using a combination of seed, secret, and include keyword. Additionally, the package allows you to insert the include keyword at a random position in the seed which will make it more difficult to guess.

It is important to keep the secret used to generate the keys secure and not share it with unauthorized parties. Additionally, the package can only be used for legitimate and legal purposes.

Please keep in mind that, even though this package provides a secure way to generate API keys, it is still important to use other security measures such as rate limiting, IP whitelisting, and encryption to protect your API and the data it accesses.

By using this package, you agree to take all necessary precautions to protect the data and resources accessed with the keys from unauthorized access or misuse. It is recommended to consult with a security expert before using this package or handling sensitive data.
